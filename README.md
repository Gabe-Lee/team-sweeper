Team Sweeper is an online multiplayer minesweeper clone for when you want the classic minesweeper experience with a social aspect.

## Current Milestone: [Stage 1: "Online Minesweeper"](#stage-1-%22online-minesweeper%22)
#### Stage 1: "Online Minesweeper"
- [ ] As a player, I want to connect to the server and be given a minesweeper game to play.
- [ ] ... When I click a square to sweep it, I want the server to respond with either the  cleared square or a death message.
- [ ] ... When I right click a square, I want the server to mark the square with a flag
- [ ] ... I want to be presented with a remaining mines counter that decreases when I flag a spot for mines.
- [ ] ... I want to have a time limit to keep me on my toes (And artificially limit the number of open games on the server).
- [ ] ... When I have cleared all non-mine spaces, I want to be given a victory message and the option to start a new game.
#### Stage 2: "Group Minesweeper"
